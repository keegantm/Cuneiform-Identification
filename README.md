# Cuneiform Identification Final Presentation

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains cuneiform transcriptions of two languages: Akkadian and Sumerian. There is one category for Summerian, and six different categories for Akkadian which represent different dialects. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wilstrup/cuneiform-language-identification/data).

## Objectives
### Primary Objective
1. Build a model to predict the language/dialect of input cuneiform.

### Secondary Objectives
1. Build a model to predict the language (Sumerian or Akkadian) of input cuneiform.
2. Create a basic visualization of the embeddings of these symbols.

## Methodology and Results
